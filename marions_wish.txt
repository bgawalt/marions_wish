# MARION'S WISH, TEXT EDITION
# Copy-pasted by bgawalt from PDF at marionswish.com
#
# Mild adjustments have been made to make the script machine-readable for the
# purposes of this Twitter bot scheme:
#
# 1. Text messages have been collapsed from multiline to single line
#
# 2. Most multiline text messages in the PDF are merely performing word-wrap,
#    so it's not a problem to collapse them to single lines here.  However,
#    some of the text messages in the PDF involve *intentional* line breaks --
#    Tim's list of TODOs for funeral arrangements, for example.  In cases where
#    those line breaks are intentional, they are represented with the word 'QQ'.
#
# 3. The media messages now look like regular lines of dialogue, but instead
#    start with the code word 'IMG', followed by a space, then a file name for
#    the media object.
#
# 4. References to emoji have been replaced with the actual emoji.
#
# 5. Time stamps are now prefaced with 'Day 0' or 'Day 1'
#
# 6. One particularly long message from Gregg has been split into two, to fit
#    within the character limits for a tweet.
#
# With affection,
#   Brian Gawalt

# Foreword
#
# For the past 7 years or so, Gregg, Mark and I have had a text thread going that has brought me
# more laughter and joy than most anything other form of media I can recall. This thread has gone
# dormant for days, but never weeks. It‚Äôs always simmering, and it‚Äôs always the same joke: a sick,
# stupid or lecherous scheme or proposition is sent to Mark by Gregg or myself, Mark stupidly
# takes the bait and things devolve into confusion, anger, accusations and general chaos. So many
# nights my wife would find me lying in bed, laughing with tears in my eyes. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre texting with
# Gregg and Mark?‚Äù Many of the threads are simply too mean, gross and ‚Äúinside‚Äù for them to work
# for public consumption, but this past week, we hit on a vein that felt a touch ‚Äúaccessible?‚Äù
# For years we talked about doing something with these ‚Äúwastes of time‚Äù and this little snippet; a
# peek into the thread for 24 hours, felt like it could be a way to test the waters. So here‚Äôs a taste.
# We‚Äôre all kind of going through hell right now and we hope this short piece (short story? play?
# What is it?) can give you a few moments of respite.
#
# Please note: This is not ‚ÄúOn Cinema Gregg, Tim or Mark.‚Äù
# I don‚Äôt know who these assholes are! All The Best!

Day 0, 10:48 PM
Tim: Unfortunately, we will have to postpone the breakfast show tomorrow. I have received word that Marion Howard just fell down some stairs and has suffered a concussion.
Mark: Oh no.
Mark: That‚Äôs awful.
Mark: Is she okay?!
Tim: She was so excited to chat with you she tumbled down the stairs apparently.
Tim: Has an awful gash on her face now.
Tim: So sad.
Mark: Geez.
Mark: That‚Äôs awful.
Tim: Will you record a special message for her?
Mark: When can we reschedule?
Tim: Wishing her well?
Mark: Of course.
Gregg: Tim I heard that Marion died. Maybe just a rumor? Aamos heard it a couple of minutes ago from Tim. Not you - Tim Smith.
Mark: Ugh.
Mark: I hope it‚Äôs not true.
Mark: Really wanted to chat with her.
Gregg: Mark if it turns out to be true - let‚Äôs put together a memorial event.
Tim: No she is hanging on.
Gregg: Tim Smith can be unreliable. I should have known.
Tim: No worries. The gash was bad and so is the head wound. She is unconscious.
Tim: They are placing her in a medically induced coma to be safe.
Tim: Mario is with her.
Gregg: Will she be able to ID the nude pics of Moe? Is her vision blurred?
Tim: Those were the images she wanted to show Mark.
Tim: She has them with her.
Gregg: The same ones Darrell has?
Tim: Mario is texting me now.
Tim: Mario is with her.
Tim: Mario is typing something.
Gregg: The ones where Moe has a hard-on?
Tim: Hang on.
Mark: Huh?
Tim: Mario said she is on life support?
Mark: Jesus.
Tim: Mario is asking what he should do.
Mark: IMG MARK_VIDEO.mp4
Tim: Mark what should Mario do?
Tim: Mark Mario thinks he should take her off life support. What do you think he should do???
Tim: He is asking you.
Mark: How the fuck should I know?!!!
Mark: I never even met the woman!
Gregg: Mark don‚Äôt do it.
Gregg: Let her have a chance.
Mark: Keep her on it!
Tim: Ok thank you!
Tim: Mario says that as well.
Mark: K
Mark: What‚Äôs wrong with him?
Mark: Why ask me?
Tim: Mario is stressed out.
Tim: He needs your guidance.
Tim: He will be in touch tomorrow to go over Marion‚Äôs last wishes if she passes away.
Gregg: Mark time for you to take your head out of your ass and actually do something here.
Tim: Let‚Äôs hope she pulls through.
Mark: You take your head out of your ads Gregg!!!
Mark: Fingers crossed Tim.
Mark: Why is he relying on me so much?
Mark: I don‚Äôt know him, do I?
Tim: No.
Tim: Mario is an oddball but Marion trusts him so much.
Tim: It‚Äôs all good.
Gregg: Mark you don‚Äôt need to be so aggressive right now. Show some maturity please.
Gregg: Mark do you want to see the Curly autopsy pics?
Tim: Mark this is confidential but Marion wants you and Mario to Manage Moe Howard‚Äôs intellectual property.
Tim: Not 3 stooges stuff but his personal photography.
Mark: Okay Tim.
Tim: Let‚Äôs pray she lives through the night. Mario will be by her side.

Gregg: He‚Äôs changed a lot Mark, he now wants to spend his time enjoying life with friends rather than fighting and provoking violence.
Tim: Bad news. I won‚Äôt be able to make this. Dealing with funeral arrangements for Marion. QQ Mark, has Mario reached out?

Gregg: Mario is dead.
Tim: Oh no.
Gregg: Yes. Tim is with the family now.
Gregg: It‚Äôs the worst thing that could‚Äôve happened.
Gregg: Mark, Tim really cared for Marion.
Gregg: Though it‚Äôs also possible Tim made it all up.
Gregg: Tim Smith is a sick guy!
Tim: Mario is not answering calls.
Gregg: Maybe if Mark calls her?
Gregg: She might answer for him.
Tim: I spoke to Mario.
Tim: Marion.
Tim: She is fine.
Tim: That was at 1:15 today.

Tim: Is son is handling his funeral. marions
Tim: Sorry Mario‚Äôs
Tim: So can you help arrange Mario‚Äôs funeral?
Gregg: Tim Smith tells me that the Mario who was in marion‚Äôs life was an imposter! He was trying to pilfer her Moe souvenirs. The REAL Mario has been in Alaska for 4 weeks working on a huge land sale.
Gregg: Tim heard from him today. He is very upset someone impersonated him. Honestly I was a little skeptical because the real Mario is not as hefty as the one who died.
Tim: Marion has put on weight recently.
Gregg: Sadly Marion was too mentally ill to be able to communicate to anyone the scam! But she must‚Äôve known.
Tim: Tim isn‚Äôt to be trusted on this
Tim: Mark can you arrange funerals.
Tim: Sorry, just Funeral for Marion
Tim: Marion‚Äôs son is handling his.
Gregg: I just don‚Äôt know what to think. Marion and Marion were very close Mark. Tim Smith was a witness to that.
Gregg: Marion wanted to be buried next to Marion.
Gregg: Marlon.
Gregg: I do believe the real Marion is still alive and mourning the loss of Marlo in Juneau Alaska.
Gregg: Mario is alive, morning Marion
Gregg: Mark, Marion wanted you to have this stuff, please pick up by noon tomorrow or you will be charged a storage fee
Gregg: IMG CABINET_FOAM.png

Gregg: Mario May be alive, Mark.
Gregg: The Mario May be a fake.
Mark: Huh?
Gregg: Marlo at Forest Lawn can check and see if ‚ÄúMario‚Äù has a Moe tattoo to the right of his balls, on his leg. If not--it‚Äôs not Mario.
Gregg: Call Marlo and ask her.
Mark: I‚Äôm not asking that.
Gregg: I trust you Tim that you have the correct information about Marion‚Äôs passing.

Tim: Don‚Äôt, he is one of the jerky boys!
Gregg: Tim is very jealous of Tim.
Mark: Please don‚Äôt.
Tim: He is very close to the Moe Howard gamy.
Tim: Family.
Mark: He was confusing.
Gregg: Tim loved Moe, Mark.
Mark: Heidecker?
Mark: I‚Äôll call Forest Lawn about Mario and Marion.
Gregg: Mario is not Mario.
Mark: ?
Gregg: It‚Äôs an imposter, and the real Mario is in Alaska.
Tim: Mark you need to do 5 things tomorrow: QQ Contact Mario at cemetery. QQ Arrange for ballbesrers. QQ Get a video of Moe‚Äôs career. QQ Send out a statement to the stooge community.
Gregg: This fake Mario stole Mario‚Äôs identit

Tim: Also alert the Fine family.
Gregg: Fake mario stoke from Marlin.
Gregg: Fake Mario stole from Marion.
Tim: Jason Fine (Larry‚Äôs grandson) will want to hear from you.
Gregg: Jason Fine is a goddamned liar.
Gregg: He is not Larry‚Äôs grandson.
Tim: There is some dispute but I believe him.
Gregg: His real name is Lawrence Marino. Not Fine.
Tim: His mother was Larry‚Äôs daughter, correct?

Tim: Mark Pray for Marions family tonight.
Mark: K
Gregg: Marion‚Äôs family all Died. The Howard‚Äôs.
Gregg: Mark, Mario (the real Mario) wants to meet with you when he returns from Alaska to share memories of his beloved Marion. You will love these stories!
Gregg: The fake Mario‚Äôs ashes should be flushed down the toilet, guys. What a scammer.
Mark: ???
Mark: ???
Mark: ?
